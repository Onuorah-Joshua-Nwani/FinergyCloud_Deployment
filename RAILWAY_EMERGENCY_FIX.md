# RAILWAY EMERGENCY FIX - 404 Fallback Issue

## Problem Diagnosis
Railway is showing HTTP/2 404 with `x-railway-fallback: true` - this means:
- The deployment failed completely 
- Railway never started your application container
- Railway is serving a fallback 404 page instead of your app
- This is NOT a 502 gateway error - it's a deployment failure

## Root Cause
Railway can't find or start your application. Common causes:
1. Railway project pointing to wrong GitHub branch
2. Railway build/start command incorrect
3. Railway port configuration wrong
4. Railway environment variables missing

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION STEPS

### Step 1: Check Railway Project Settings
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Open your FinergyCloud project
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Check **Source Repository**: Should point to `Onuorah-Joshua-Nwani/ojn-msp-1-finergycloud`
5. Check **Branch**: Make sure it's pointing to `main` or `master` (whichever has your latest changes)

### Step 2: Fix Railway Configuration
In Railway project settings:
1. **Build Command**: Leave EMPTY (let Docker handle it)
2. **Start Command**: `node index.js`
3. **Port**: `$PORT` (Railway auto-provides this)

### Step 3: Force Redeploy
1. In Railway dashboard, go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"Trigger Deploy"** or **"Redeploy"**
3. Do NOT use "Deploy from GitHub" - use direct redeploy

### Step 4: Check Railway Logs
1. After redeploy, immediately check **Logs** tab in Railway
2. Look for build errors or container startup errors
3. If you see "Error: Cannot find module" - the deployment is using wrong files

## Alternative: Create New Railway Project
If the above doesn't work, the Railway project may be corrupted:

1. Create a NEW Railway project
2. Connect it to your GitHub repo: `Onuorah-Joshua-Nwani/ojn-msp-1-finergycloud`
3. Set domain to: `finergycloud-production.up.railway.app`
4. Deploy with these settings:
   - Build Command: (empty)
   - Start Command: `node index.js`
   - Root Directory: `/`

## Files That Should Be in Your Repo
These must exist in your GitHub root directory:

**index.js** (minimal Node.js server):
```javascript
const http = require('http');
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log(`${new Date().toISOString()} - ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  
  if (req.url === '/health') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
    res.end(JSON.stringify({ status: 'healthy', service: 'FinergyCloud' }));
    return;
  }
  
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
  res.end(`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html><head><title>FinergyCloud</title></head>
<body style="font-family:Arial;text-align:center;padding:50px;background:#1a365d;color:white;">
<h1>ðŸŒ± FinergyCloud LIVE</h1>
<p>Railway deployment successful - ${new Date().toLocaleString()}</p>
<p>Port: ${PORT} | Uptime: ${Math.floor(process.uptime())}s</p>
</body></html>`);
});

server.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`FinergyCloud running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

**Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY index.js .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

**railway.json**:
```json
{
  "build": { "builder": "DOCKERFILE" },
  "deploy": { "startCommand": "node index.js" }
}
```

## Expected Fix Time
Once Railway configuration is corrected, deployment should work within 2-3 minutes.

## What to Look For
After fix, you should see:
- Railway logs showing "FinergyCloud running on port XXXX"
- Domain showing FinergyCloud landing page
- No more 404 fallback responses
