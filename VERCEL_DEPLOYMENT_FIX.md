# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem
Vercel is showing compiled server code instead of your React website because it's not properly configured for a full-stack application.

## Solution Files to Add to GitHub

### 1. vercel.json (in root directory)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist/public"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/server.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. api/server.js (create new directory and file)
```javascript
import express from 'express';
export default express();
```

### 3. Update package.json scripts (if needed)
Ensure you have:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build --config vite.config.production.ts",
    "vercel-build": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

## Alternative: Deploy Only Frontend to Vercel

Since your app can run without a backend (uses demo data), you can deploy just the frontend:

### Option 1: Frontend-Only Deployment
1. Create a new repository with only these folders:
   - `client/` (your React app)
   - `shared/` (shared types)
   - `package.json` with frontend dependencies only

2. Use this vercel.json:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "client/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "../dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Recommended Solution
Since your app has demo authentication and can work without a real backend:

1. Deploy frontend-only to Vercel (fast and simple)
2. Keep Railway for full-stack with database
3. Use different domains for different purposes:
   - Vercel: Marketing website and demos
   - Railway: Full application with user accounts

## Quick Fix
Add these files to your GitHub repository:
- `vercel.json` (as shown above)
- Update your build configuration
- Redeploy on Vercel

Your site should then show the proper React frontend instead of server code.
