ESG COMPONENT ALLOCATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Environmental (E):  40%  ████████████████████████████████████████
Social (S):         40%  ████████████████████████████████████████
Governance (G):     20%  ████████████████████
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Rationale: Environmental and Social factors carry equal weight in emerging 
markets where community impact and environmental sustainability are 
equally critical for project success.

## **Overall ESG Risk Scoring Matrix**

### **Composite ESG Score Calculation**
```
FINAL ESG SCORE FORMULA:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ESG_Score = (Environmental × 0.40) + (Social × 0.40) + (Governance × 0.20)

Where:
• Environmental = Weighted average of E-components (max 100)
• Social = Weighted average of S-components (max 100)  
• Governance = Weighted average of G-components (max 100)

Example Calculation:
E_Score = 85 (Grid integration strong, good carbon impact)
S_Score = 78 (Strong community, moderate job creation)
G_Score = 82 (Good framework, adequate transparency)

Final ESG = (85 × 0.40) + (78 × 0.40) + (82 × 0.20) = 81.6 → 82

## **Real-Time Risk Assessment Algorithm**

### **Dynamic Risk Scoring Process**
```
STEP 1: Base ESG Calculation
├─ Calculate Environmental Score (E × 0.40)
├─ Calculate Social Score (S × 0.40)  
├─ Calculate Governance Score (G × 0.20)
└─ Sum for Base ESG Score

STEP 2: Technology Adjustment
├─ Apply technology risk modifier
├─ Adjust for technology maturity
└─ Account for local expertise

STEP 3: Geographic Adjustment  
├─ Apply country/region modifier
├─ Include political risk factor
├─ Adjust for currency volatility
└─ Factor infrastructure quality

STEP 4: Project Size Scaling
├─ Scale for project capacity
├─ Adjust complexity factors
├─ Include operational risk
└─ Apply economies of scale

STEP 5: Final Risk Classification
├─ Calculate adjusted ESG score
├─ Determine risk band
├─ Generate investment recommendation
├─ Assign confidence score
└─ Provide monitoring frequency
