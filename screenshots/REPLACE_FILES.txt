âœ… SCREENSHOT SETUP COMPLETE

Your README.md now uses placeholder images that work immediately. To add your real screenshots:

METHOD 1 - GITHUB UPLOAD (RECOMMENDED):
1. Take screenshots of your app
2. Go to your GitHub repository
3. Create a folder called "screenshots" 
4. Create subfolders "website" and "mobile"
5. Upload your images with these exact names:

WEBSITE SCREENSHOTS (upload to screenshots/website/):
- dashboard-overview.png
- esg-scoring.png  
- ai-predictions.png
- portfolio-management.png

MOBILE SCREENSHOTS (upload to screenshots/mobile/):
- mobile-dashboard.png
- mobile-projects.png
- mobile-analytics.png
- mobile-esg.png
- mobile-predictions.png
- mobile-profile.png

6. Update the README.md file to change the placeholder URLs to:
   From: https://via.placeholder.com/...
   To: screenshots/website/filename.png or screenshots/mobile/filename.png

METHOD 2 - LOCAL FILES:
The files are already created in this Replit environment. You can download them and upload to GitHub.

Your README.md currently shows working placeholder images until you replace them with real screenshots.
